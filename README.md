# Minecraft-Custom-Modpack
This repository is for self tested customized modpack.

## Background
  I am kind of old gamer for Minecraft, just want the original survival experience and don't need the fancy mod that may made me invincible.
  This is why I create this *modpack* ( maybe this is not a modpack, just a mod collection ).

## PC configuration
  - *CPU: AMD 5600X*
  - *MB: ASUS TUF B550M-Plus(WiFi)*
  - *GPU: ASUS TUF-RTX3070-O8G-GAMING (GeForce Drive Version 516.94)*
  - *Mem: Acer Predator 16GBx2 (OC 3800 CL-16-16-16-36 1.35V)*

## Basic game version
  Current use **1.19.2**.
  
## Collection list
   Mods/Shaderpacks/Resourcepacks in list already tested locally, for last four days running, no error, no blink, no crash.
   Please refer to the README.md under the seperate folder to find the details infomation.
   Most of them are basically enhanced the visual and handle experience, only Expanded Storage, Autofish and Travelor's Backpack kind of **cheating** in game.

## Declaration
